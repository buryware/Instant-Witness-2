    <string name="about_iw">Instant Witnesses designed to do exactly that generate Witnesses instantly to your situation. Whether you\'re the potential victim of a an aggressive attack
        or a bully or you\'re just wanting to show off something that you can do.
    Instant Witnesses is where a neighborhood watch , Amber Alert , Red Alert and 911 all come together.\n\n
    Instant witness will immediately alert everyone with the app installed, within a specified radius of your location that you need assistance or that there is something going on.\n\n
    It is designed as a single swipe from the lock screen on your phone to automatically activate the audio/video  and send a one-way broadcast and your GPS location to everyone to let
        them know that you\'re in need of witnesses and potentially help.
    Instant witness does not promote any physical confrontation but it does promote you to show up and be a witness.\n\n
    If you talk to any victim of a person on person crime, while that crime is going on the thought going through their head is \'someone , anyone please ju
        how up \' now instant
        witness will give you the ability to alert that someone that is close by.
    The hope with instant witness is not only to generate potential witnesses to what\'s going on but also to close the gap in response time to your location and situation.\n\n
    Instant witness has a pin code deactivation feature similar to a home security system that prevents anyone from you from shutting it off. So if you activate it,
        someone cannot grab your phone and just shut it off.\n\nCopyrght 2018 Buryware\n\nCreated by Jason Nelson and Steve Stansbury</string>
